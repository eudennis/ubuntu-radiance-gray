Radiance Gray - Ubuntu Theme
====================

A gray version of the Ubuntu default Light Themes (Ambiance &amp; Radiance).

I just modified the original Radiance theme to make ir gray instead the original light brow.

This work based on the version 0.1.93 of the Light Theme package. The original theme is designed by Canonical.

Tested on Ubuntu 12.10 only. Report any ideia and bugs to make ir better :)

<h2>How to install?</h2>

<p>Download this repository and move it to <em>/usr/share/themes/</em> and select the theme (I recommend <em>Ubuntu Tweak</em> or <em>Unity Tweak Tools)</em></p>


Thanks.
